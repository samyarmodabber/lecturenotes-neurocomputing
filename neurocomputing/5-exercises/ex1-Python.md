# Introduction to Python

This exercise is an introduction to Python for absolute beginners. If you already know Python, you can safely skip it. 

The next files are the notebook (which you have to fill) and the solution (which you can look at after you finished the exercise). It is recommended not to look at the the solution while doing the exercise unless you are lost. 

To download the notebook, there is a link on the top right where you can download the `.ipynb` file. Alternatively, you can run it directly on Colab (<https://colab.research.google.com/>) if you have a Google account.
