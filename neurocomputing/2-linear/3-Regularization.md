## A bit of learning theory

Before going further, let's think about what we have been doing so far. We had a bunch of data samples $\mathcal{D} = (\mathbf{x}_i, t_i)_{i=1..N}$ (the **training set**). We decided to apply a (linear) model on it:

$$y_i = \langle \mathbf{w} . \mathbf{x}_i \rangle + b$$

We then minimized the mean square error (mse) on that training set using gradient descent:

$$
    \mathcal{L}(w, b) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, t \in \mathcal{D}} [(t_i - y_i )^2]
$$

At the end of learning, we can measure the **residual error** of the model on the data:

$$
    \epsilon_\mathcal{D} = \frac{1}{N} \, \sum_{i=1}^{N} (t_i - y_i )^2
$$

We get a number, for example 0.04567. Is that good?

The **mean square error** mse is not very informative, as its value depends on how the outputs are scaled: multiply the targets and prediction by 10 and the mse is 100 times higher.

The residual error measures the quality of the fit, but it is sensible to the scaling of the outputs.
```


The **coefficient of determination** $R^2$ is a rescaled variant of the mse comparing the variance of the residuals to the variance of the data around its mean $\hat{t}$:

$$
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{Var}(\text{residuals})}{\text{Var}(\text{data})} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (t_i- y_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N (t_i - \hat{t})^2}
$$

$R^2$ should be as close from 1 as possible. For example, if $R^2 = 0.8$, we can say that the **model explains 80% of the variance of the data**.

```


### Sensibility to outliers

Suppose we have a training set with one **outlier** (bad measurement, bad luck, etc).

```{figure} ../img/regression-outlier.png
---
width: 70%
---

```

LMS would find the minimum of the mse, but it is clearly a bad fit for most points.

```{figure} ../img/regression-outlier-fit.png
---
width: 70%
---
LMS is attracted by the outlier, leading to a bad prediction for all points.
```

This model feels much better, but its residual mse is actually higher...

```{figure} ../img/regression-outlier-fit-corrected.png
---
width: 70%
---
By ignoring the outlier, the prediction would be correct for most points. 
```

Let's visualize polynomial regression with various orders of the polynomial on a small dataset.


```{figure} ../img/polynomialregression-animation.gif

```


When only looking at the residual mse on the training data, one could think that the higher the order of the polynomial, the better. But it is obvious that the interpolation quickly becomes very bad when the order is too high. A **complex** model (with a lot of parameters) is useless for predicting new values. We actually do **not** care about the error on the training set, but about **generalization**.

### Cross-validation

Letâ€™s suppose we dispose of $m$ models $\mathcal{M} = \{ M_1, ..., M_m\}$ that could be used to fit (or classify) some data $\mathcal{D} = \{\mathbf{x}_i, t_i\}_{i=1}^N$. Such a class could be the ensemble of polynomes with different orders, different algorithms (NN, SVM) or the same algorithm with different values for the hyperparameters (learning rate, regularization parameters...).

The naive and **wrong** method to find the best hypothesis would be:

```{admonition} Do not do this!
- For all models $M_i$:

    - Train $M_i$ on $\mathcal{D}$ to obtain an hypothesis $h_i$.

    - Compute the training error $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(h_i)$ of $h_i$ on $\mathcal{D}$ :

    $$
        \epsilon_\mathcal{D}(h_i) =  \mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x}, t) \in \mathcal{D}} [(h_i(\mathbf{x}) - t)^2]
    $$

- Select the hypothesis $h_{i}^*$ with the minimal training error : $h_{i}^* = \text{argmin}_{h_i \in \mathcal{M}} \quad \epsilon_\mathcal{D}(h_i)$
```

This method leads to **overfitting**, as only the training error is used.

The solution is randomly take some samples out of the training set to form the **test set**. Typical values are 20 or 30 % of the samples in the test set.

1. Train the model on the training set (70% of the data).
2. Test the performance of the model on the test set (30% of the data).

```{figure} ../img/polynomialregression-traintest.png

width: 70%

```

The test performance will better measure how well the model generalizes to new examples.


```{admonition} Simple hold-out cross-validation

* Split the training data $\mathcal{D}$ into $\mathcal{S}_{\text{train}}$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\text{test}}$.

* For all models $M_i$:

    * Train $M_i$ on $\mathcal{S}_{\text{train}}$ to obtain an hypothesis $h_i$.

    * Compute the empirical error $\epsilon_{\text{test}}(h_i)$ of $h_i$ on $\mathcal{S}_{\text{test}}$ :

    $$\epsilon_{\text{test}}(h_i) = \mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x}, t) \in  \mathcal{S}_{\text{test}}} [(h_i(\mathbf{x}) - t)^2]$$

* Select the hypothesis $h_{i}^*$ with the minimal empirical error : $h_{i}^* = \text{argmin}_{h_i \in \mathcal{M}} \quad \epsilon_{\text{test}}(h_i)$
```

The disadvantage of **simple hold-out cross-validation** is that 20 or 30% of the data is wasted and not used for learning. It may be a problem when data is rare or expensive.

**k-fold cross-validation** allows a more efficient use os the available data and a better measure of the generalization error. The idea is to build several different training/test sets with the same data, train and test each model repeatedly on each partition and choose the hypothesis that works best on average.

```

```{admonition} k-fold cross-validation
* Randomly split the data $\mathcal{D}$ into $k$ subsets of $\frac{N}{k}$ examples $\{ \mathcal{S}_{1}, \dots , \mathcal{S}_{k}\}$

* For all models $M_i$:

    * For all $k$ subsets $\mathcal{S}_j$:

        * Train $M_i$ on $\mathcal{D} - \mathcal{S}_j$ to obtain an hypothesis $h_{ij}$

        * Compute the empirical error $\epsilon_{\mathcal{S}_j}(h_{ij})$ of $h_{ij}$ on $\mathcal{S}_j$

    * The empirical error of the model $M_i$ on $\mathcal{D}$ is the average of empirical errors made on $(\mathcal{S}_j)_{j=1}^{k}$
        
        $$
            \epsilon_{\mathcal{D}} (M_i) = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{k} \epsilon_{\mathcal{S}_j}(h_{ij})
        $$
* Select the model $M_{i}^*$ with the minimal empirical error on $\mathcal{D}$.
```

In general, you can take $k=10$ partitions. The extreme case is to take $k=N$ partition, i.e. the test set has only one sample each time: **leave-one-out cross-validation**. k-fold cross-validation works well, but needs a lot of repeated learning.

### Underfitting - overfitting

While the training mse always decrease with more complex models, the test mse increases after a while. This is called **overfitting**: learning by heart the data without caring about generalization. The two curves suggest that we should chose a polynomial order between 2 and 9.

```{figure} ../img/polynomialregression-mse-traintest.png

```


A model not complex enough for the data will **underfit**: its training error is high. A model too complex for the data will **overfit**: its test error is high. In between, there is the right complexity for the model: it learns the data correctly but does not overfit. 

```{figure} ../img/underfitting-overfitting.png

Underfitting and overfitting.
```

What does complexity mean? In polynomial regression, the complexity is related to the order of the polynomial, i.e. the number of coefficients to estimate:

$$y = f_{\mathbf{w}, b}(x) = \sum_{k=1}^p w_k \, x^k + b$$


$$\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ x^2 \\ \ldots \\ x^p \end{bmatrix} \qquad \mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ \ldots \\ w_p \end{bmatrix}$$

A polynomial of order $p$ has $p+1$ unknown parameters (**free parameters**): the $p$ weights and the bias. Generally, the **complexity of a model** relates to its **number of free parameters**:

> **The more free parameters, the more complex the model is, the more likely it will overfit.**


Under-/Over-fitting relates to the statistical concept of **bias-variance trade-off**. The **bias** is the training error that the hypothesis would make if the training set was infinite (accuracy, flexibility of the model): a model with high bias is underfitting. The **variance** is the error that will be made by the hypothesis on new examples taken from the same distribution (spread, the model is correct on average, but not for individual samples): a model with high variance is overfitting.

```

The bias decreases when the model becomes complex; the variance increases when the model becomes complex. The **generalization error** is a combination of the bias and variance:

$$
    \text{generalization error} = \text{bias}^2 + \text{variance}
$$

We search for the model with the **optimum complexity** realizing the trade-off between bias and variance. It is better to have a model with a slightly higher bias (training error) but with a smaller variance (generalization error).

## Regularized regression

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6R46KLgfw5s' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Linear regression can either underfit or overfit depending on the data.


```{figure} ../img/underfitting-overfitting-linear.png

Linear regression underfits non-linear data.
```

```{figure} ../img/regression-outlier-fit.png
---

---
Linear regression overfits outliers.
```

When linear regression **underfits** (both training and test errors are high), the data is not linear: we need to use a **neural network**. When linear regression **overfits** (the test error is higher than the training error), we would like to **decrease its complexity**.


The problem is that the number of free parameters in linear regression only depends on the number of inputs (dimensions of the input space).

$$
    y = \sum_{i=1}^d w_i \, x_i + b
$$

For $d$ inputs, there are $d+1$ free parameters: the $d$ weights and the bias.

We must find a way to reduce the complexity of the linear regression without changing the number of parameters, which is impossible. The solution is to **constrain** the values that the parameters can take: **regularization**. Regularization reduces the variance at the cost of increasing the bias.


### L2 regularization - Ridge regression

Using **L2 regularization** for linear regression leads to the **Ridge regression** algorithm. The individual loss function is defined as:

$$
    \mathcal{l}_i(\mathbf{w}, b) = (t_i - y_i)^2 + \lambda \, ||\mathbf{w}||^2
$$

The first part of the loss function is the classical **mse** on the training set: its role is to reduce the **bias**. The second part minimizes the L2 norm of the weight vector (or matrix), reducing the variance:

$$
    ||\mathbf{w}||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^d w_i^2
$$

Deriving the regularized delta learning rule is straightforward:

$$
    \Delta w_i = \eta \, ((t_i - y_i) \ x_i - \lambda \, w_i)
$$

Ridge regression is also called **weight decay**: even if there is no error, all weights will decay to 0.

```


### L1 regularization - LASSO regression

Using **L1 regularization** for linear regression leads to the **LASSO regression** algorithm (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). The individual loss function is defined as:

$$
    \mathcal{l}_i(\mathbf{w}, b) =  (t_i - y_i)^2 + \lambda \, |\mathbf{w}|
$$

The second part minimizes this time the L1 norm of the weight vector, i.e. its absolute value:

$$
    |\mathbf{w}| = \sum_{i=1}^d |w_i|
$$

Regularized delta learning rule with LASSO:

$$
    \Delta w_i = \eta \, ((t_i - y_i) \ x_i - \lambda \, \text{sign}(w_i))
$$

**Weight decay** does not depend on the value of the weight, only its sign. Weights can decay very fast to 0.

width: 60%
---
LASSO regression tries to set as many weight to 0 as possible (sparse code). Source: <https://www.mlalgorithms.org/articles/l1-l2-regression/>
```

Both methods depend on the **regularization parameter** $\lambda$. Its value determines how important the regularization term should. Regularization introduce a **bias**, as the solution found is **not** the minimum of the mse, but reduces the variance of the estimation, as small weights are less sensible to noise.



LASSO allows **feature selection**: features with a zero weight can be removed from the training set.

```


### L1+L2 regularization - ElasticNet


An **ElasticNet** is a linear regression using both L1 and L2 regression:

$$
    \mathcal{l}_i(\mathbf{w}, b) =  (t_i - y_i)^2 + \lambda_1 \, |\mathbf{w}| + \lambda_2 \, ||\mathbf{w}||^2
$$

It combines the advantages of Ridge and LASSO, at the cost of having now two regularization parameters to determine.
