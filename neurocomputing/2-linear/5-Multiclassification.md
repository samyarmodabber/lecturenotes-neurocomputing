# Multi-class classification

## Multi-class classification

Can we perform multi-class classification using the previous methods when $t \in \{A, B, C\}$ instead of $t = +1$ or $-1$? There are two main solutions:

* **One-vs-All** (or One-vs-the-rest): one trains simultaneously a binary (linear) classifier for each class. The examples belonging to this class form the positive class, all others are the negative class:

    * A vs. B and C
    * B vs. A and C
    * C vs. A and B

If multiple classes are predicted for a single example, ones needs a confidence level for each classifier saying how sure it is of its prediction.

* **One-vs-One**: one trains a classifier for each pair of class:

    * A vs. B
    * B vs. C
    * C vs. A

A majority vote is then performed to find the correct class.

## Softmax linear classifier

Suppose we have $C$ classes (dog vs. cat vs. ship vs...). The One-vs-All scheme involves $C$ binary classifiers $(\mathbf{w}_i, b_i)$, each with a weight vector and a bias, working on the same input $\mathbf{x}$.

$$y_i = f(\langle \mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{x} \rangle + b_i)$$

Putting all neurons together, we obtain a **linear perceptron** similar to multiple linear regression:

$$
    \mathbf{y} = f(W \times \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})
$$

The $C$ weight vectors form a $d\times C$ **weight matrix** $W$, the biases form a vector $\mathbf{b}$.

```

The net activations form a vector $\mathbf{z}$:

$$
    \mathbf{z} = f_{W, \mathbf{b}}(\mathbf{x}) = W \times \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}
$$

Each element $z_j$ of the vector $\mathbf{z}$ is called the **logit score** of the class:  the higher the score, the more likely the input belongs to this class. The logit scores are not probabilities, as they can be negative and do not sum to 1.


### One-hot encoding

How do we represent the ground truth $\mathbf{t}$ for each neuron? The target vector $\mathbf{t}$ is represented using **one-hot encoding**. The binary vector has one element per class: only one element is 1, the others are 0. Example:

$$
    \mathbf{t} = [\text{cat}, \text{dog}, \text{ship}, \text{house}, \text{car}] = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
$$

The labels can be seen as a **probability distribution** over the training set, in this case a **multinomial** distribution (a dice with $C$ sides). For a given image $\mathbf{x}$ (e.g. a picture of a dog), the conditional pmf is defined by the one-hot encoded vector $\mathbf{t}$:

$$P(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x}) = [P(\text{cat}| \mathbf{x}), P(\text{dog}| \mathbf{x}), P(\text{ship}| \mathbf{x}), P(\text{house}| \mathbf{x}), P(\text{car}| \mathbf{x})] = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]$$

The logit scores $\mathbf{z}$ cannot be compared to the targets $\mathbf{t}$: we need to transform them into a probability distribution $\mathbf{y}$.
```

We need to transform the logit score $\mathbf{z}$ into a **probability distribution** $P(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x})$ that should be as close as possible from $P(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x})$.

### Softmax activation

The **softmax** operator makes sure that the sum of the outputs $\mathbf{y} = \{y_i\}$ over all classes is 1.

$$
    y_j = P(\text{class = j} | \mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{S}(z_j) = \frac{\exp(z_j)}{\sum_k \exp(z_k)}
$$

```

The higher $z_j$, the higher the probability that the example belongs to class $j$. This is very similar to logistic regression for soft classification, except that we have multiple classes.


### Cross-entropy loss function

We cannot use the mse as a loss function, as the softmax function would be hard to differentiate:

$$
    \text{mse}(W, \mathbf{b}) = \sum_j (t_{j} - \frac{\exp(z_j)}{\sum_k \exp(z_k)})^2
$$

We actually want to minimize the statistical distance netween two distributions:

* The model outputs a multinomial probability distribution $\mathbf{y}$ for an input $\mathbf{x}$: $P(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}; W, \mathbf{b})$.
* The one-hot encoded classes also come from a multinomial probability distribution $P(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x})$.

We search which parameters $(W, \mathbf{b})$ make the two distributions $P(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}; W, \mathbf{b})$ and $P(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x})$ close. The training data $\{\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{t}_i\}$ represents samples from $P(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x})$. $P(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}; W, \mathbf{b})$ is a good model of the data when the two distributions are close, i.e. when the **negative log-likelihood** of each sample under the model is small.

```{figure} ../img/crossentropy.svg

Cross-entropy between two distributions $X$ and $Y$: are samples of $X$ likely under $Y$?
```

For an input $\mathbf{x}$, we minimize the **cross-entropy** between the target distribution and the predicted outputs:

$$
    \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b}) = \mathcal{H}(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}) =  \mathbb{E}_{t \sim P(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x})} [ - \log P(\mathbf{y} = t | \mathbf{x})]
$$

The cross-entropy samples from $\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x}$:

$$
    \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b}) = \mathcal{H}(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}) =  \mathbb{E}_{t \sim P(\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x})} [ - \log P(\mathbf{y} = t | \mathbf{x})]
$$

For a given input $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{t}$ is non-zero only for the correct class $t^*$, as $\mathbf{t}$ is a one-hot encoded vector $[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]$:

$$
    \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b}) =  - \log P(\mathbf{y} = t^* | \mathbf{x})
$$

If we note $j^*$ the index of the correct class $t^*$, the cross entropy is simply:

$$
    \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b}) =  - \log y_{j^*}
$$

As only one element of $\mathbf{t}$ is non-zero, the cross-entropy is the same as the **negative log-likelihood** of the prediction for the true label:

$$
    \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b}) =  - \log y_{j^*}
$$

The minimum of $- \log y$ is obtained when $y =1$: We want to classifier to output a probability 1 for the true label. Because of the softmax activation function, the probability for the other classes should become closer from 0.

$$
    y_j = P(\text{class = j}) = \frac{\exp(z_j)}{\sum_k \exp(z_k)}
$$

Minimizing the cross-entropy / negative log-likelihood pushes the output distribution $\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}$ to be as close as possible to the target distribution $\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x}$.

Minimizing the cross-entropy between $\mathbf{t} | \mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}$ makes them similar.
```

As $\mathbf{t}$ is a binary vector $[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]$, the cross-entropy / negative log-likelihood can also be noted as the dot product between $\mathbf{t}$ and $\log \mathbf{y}$:

$$
    \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b}) = - \langle \mathbf{t} \cdot \log \mathbf{y} \rangle = - \sum_{j=1}^C t_j \, \log y_j =  - \log y_{j^*}
$$

The **cross-entropy loss function** is then the expectation over the training set of the individual cross-entropies:

$$
    \mathcal{L}(W, \mathbf{b}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t} \sim \mathcal{D}} [- \langle \mathbf{t} \cdot \log \mathbf{y} \rangle ] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N - \langle \mathbf{t}_i \cdot \log \mathbf{y}_i \rangle
$$

The nice thing with the **cross-entropy** loss function, when used on a softmax activation function, is that the partial derivative w.r.t the logit score $\mathbf{z}$ is simple:

$$
\begin{split}
    \frac{\partial {l}(W, \mathbf{b})}{\partial z_i} & = - \sum_j \frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}  t_j \log(y_j)=
- \sum_j t_j \frac{\partial \log(y_j)}{\partial z_i} = - \sum_j t_j \frac{1}{y_j} \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial z_i} \\
& = - \frac{t_i}{y_i} \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial z_i} - \sum_{j \neq i}^C \frac{t_j}{y_j} \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial z_i}
= - \frac{t_i}{y_i} y_i (1-y_i) - \sum_{j \neq i}^C \frac{t_j}{y_i} (-y_j \, y_i) \\
& = - t_i + t_i \, y_i + \sum_{j \neq i}^C t_j \, y_i = - y_i + \sum_{j = 1}^C t_j y_i
= -t_i + y_i \sum_{j = 1}^C t_j \\
& = - (t_i - y_i)
\end{split}
$$

i.e. the same as with the mse in linear regression! refer <https://peterroelants.github.io/posts/cross-entropy-softmax/> for more explanations on the proof. Vector notation:

$$
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b})}{\partial \mathbf{z}} =  -  (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) 
$$

As:

$$
    \mathbf{z} = W \times \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}
$$

we can obtain the partial derivatives:

$$
\begin{cases}
    \dfrac{\partial \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b})}{\partial W} = \dfrac{\partial \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b})}{\partial \mathbf{z}} \times \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial W} = - (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) \times \mathbf{x}^T \\
    \\
    \dfrac{\partial \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b})}{\partial \mathbf{b}} = \dfrac{\partial \mathcal{l}(W, \mathbf{b})}{\partial \mathbf{z}} \times \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{b}} = - (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) \\
\end{cases}
$$

So gradient descent leads to the **delta learning rule**:

$$
\begin{cases}
    \Delta W = \eta \,  (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) \times \mathbf{x}^T \\
    \\
    \Delta \mathbf{b} = \eta \,  (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) \\
\end{cases}
$$

* We first compute the **logit scores** $\mathbf{z}$ using a linear layer:

$$
    \mathbf{z} = W \times \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}
$$

* We turn them into probabilities $\mathbf{y}$ using the **softmax activation function**:


$$
    y_j = \frac{\exp(z_j)}{\sum_k \exp(z_k)}
$$

* We minimize the **cross-entropy** / **negative log-likelihood** on the training set:

$$
    \mathcal{L}(W, \mathbf{b}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t} \sim \mathcal{D}} [ - \langle \mathbf{t} \cdot \log \mathbf{y} \rangle]
$$

which simplifies into the **delta learning rule**:

$$
\begin{cases}
    \Delta W = \eta \,  (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) \times \mathbf{x}^T \\
    \\
    \Delta \mathbf{b} = \eta \,  (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) \\
\end{cases}
$$
```


### Comparison of linear classification and regression

Classification and regression differ in the nature of their outputs: in classification they are discrete, in regression they are continuous values. However, when trying to minimize the mismatch between a model $\mathbf{y}$ and the real data $\mathbf{t}$, we have found the same **delta learning rule**:

$$
\begin{cases}
    \Delta W = \eta \,  (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) \times \mathbf{x}^T \\
    \\
    \Delta \mathbf{b} = \eta \,  (\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y} ) \\
\end{cases}
$$

Regression and classification are in the end the same problem for us. The only things that needs to be adapted is the activation function of the output and the **loss function**:

* For regression, we use regular activation functions and the **mean square error** (mse):

    $$
    \mathcal{L}(W, \mathbf{b}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathcal{D}} [ ||\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{y}||^2 ]
    $$

* For classification, we use the softmax activation function and the **cross-entropy** (negative log-likelihood) loss function:

    $$\mathcal{L}(W, \mathbf{b}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t} \sim \mathcal{D}} [ - \langle \mathbf{t} \cdot \log \mathbf{y} \rangle]$$

## Multi-label classification

What if there is more than one label on the image? The target vector $\mathbf{t}$ does not represent a probability distribution anymore:

$$
    \mathbf{t} = [\text{cat}, \text{dog}, \text{ship}, \text{house}, \text{car}] = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
$$

Normalizing the vector does not help: it is not a dog **or** a cat, it is a dog **and** a cat.

$$
    \mathbf{t} = [\text{cat}, \text{dog}, \text{ship}, \text{house}, \text{car}] = [0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0]
$$

For multi-label classification, we can simply use the **logistic** activation function for the output neurons:

$$
    \mathbf{y} = \sigma(W \times \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})
$$

The outputs are between 0 and 1, but they do not sum to one. Each output neuron performs **linear regression for soft classification** on their class:

$$y_j = P(\text{class} = j | \mathbf{x})$$

Each output neuron $y_j$ has a binary target $t_j$ (one-vs-the-rest) and has to minimize the negative log-likelihood:

$$
\mathcal{l}_j(W, \mathbf{b}) =  - t_j \, \log y_j + (1 - t_j) \, \log( 1- y_j)
$$

The **binary cross-entropy** loss for the whole network is the sum of the negative log-likelihood for each class:

$$
\mathcal{L}(W, \mathbf{b}) =  \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} [- \sum_{j=1}^C t_j \, \log y_j + (1 - t_j) \, \log( 1- y_j)]
$$
