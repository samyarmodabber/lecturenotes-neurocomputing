# Neurocomputing


These are the lecture notes for the module **Neurocomputing** taught by Dr. Julien Vitay at the Technische Universität Chemnitz, Faculty of Computer Science, Professorship for Artificial Intelligence. 

The content will be uploaded on a regular basis during the semester. Registration to the course happens on OPAL:

<https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal/auth/RepositoryEntry/21637267460>

Each section is accompanied by a video (the slides are also available) and followed by some lecture notes which summarize the most important points to understand. Some sections are optional in the sense that no questions will be asked at the exam, but those interested in becoming neural network experts should feel free to study them.

Exercises are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, allowing to implement in Python at your own pace the algorithms seen in the lectures and learn to use machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `keras` and `tensorflow`.
