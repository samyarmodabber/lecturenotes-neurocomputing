    "Python is a powerful, flexible programming language widely used for scientific computing, in web/Internet development, to write desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), create games, and much more. It became the *de facto* standard for machine learning, with a huge variety of specialized libraries such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `scikit-learn` <https://scikit-learn.org/>, a toolbox with a multitude of ML algorithms already implemented.\n",
    "* `tensorflow` <https://tensorflow.org/>, an automatic differentiation library by Google for deep learning.\n",
    "* `pytorch` <https://pytorch.org/>, another popular automatic differentiation library by Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an high-level, interpreted, object-oriented language written in C, which means it is compiled on-the-fly, at run-time execution. Its syntax is close to C, but without prototyping (whether a variable is an integer or a string will be automatically determined by the context). It can be executed either directly in an interpreter (Ã  la Matlab), in a script or in a notebook (as here).\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python should be already installed if you use Linux, a very old version if you use MacOS, and probably nothing under Windows. Moreover, Python 2.7 became obsolete in December 2019 but is still the default on some distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, we strongly recommend installing Python 3 using the Anaconda distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda offers all the major Python packages in one place, with a focus on data science and machine learning. To install it, simply download the installer / script for your OS and follow the instructions. Beware, the installation takes quite a lot of space on the disk (around 1 GB), so choose the installation path wisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install packages (for example `tensorflow`), you just have to type in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install tensorflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the docs (<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/>) to know more. If you prefer your local Python installation, the `pip` utility allows to also install virtually any Python package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install tensorflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to run the notebooks in the cloud, for example on Google Colab:\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://colab.research.google.com/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Colab has all major ML packages already installed, so you do not have to care about anything. Under conditions, you can also use a GPU for free (but for maximally 24 hours in a row)."

For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. ROT-13 (\"rotate by 13 places\") is a widely used example of a Caesar cipher where the shift is 13. In Python, the key for ROT-13 may be represented by means of the following dictionary:"
